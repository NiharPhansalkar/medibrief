Introducing 'MediBrief'

An efficient medical text summarizer
simplifying the task of summarizing printed clinical notes using advanced Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP). By scanning digital notes with OCR (performed using Tesseract), medibrief converts printed text into editable format. By being able to seamlessly convert a large volume of printed documents into editable text, OCR technology can help professionals save time while the summarization will ensure comprehensive understanding of diagnoses.
